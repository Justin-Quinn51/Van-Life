## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** React, React Router, Tailwind, Firebase, Vite

The goal of this project was to improve my React knowledge by learning, and utilizing React Router to solve the issue of nested navigation. 
I also utilized React's built in hooks such as, useState and useEffect, as well as React Router hooks like useLocation, and useParams. Conditional
rendering was vital to showing the proper data based on user selection, as was a filtering mechanism used to narrow search criteria. Try/Catch blocks
were used for error handling, and async/await was implemented to deal with asynchronous data fetching.

## Lessons Learned:

This project represented a great experience in composing a very modular, multi-tiered application that was significantly more complex than
any of my previous attempts. Despite this, there are definitely improvements that can be made.

Constructing a true authentication system that provides ample security to the user, and persists their sessions would be something great to implement.
Additionally, using a headless component library such as Radix to get prebuilt components, which I could later style myself, as opposed to 
using images, would improve the look of the app, and make the design more cohesive. Finally, the app was built to be mobile friendly, but my
next goal is to make it entirely responsive, so that all manner of devices can have a better user experience.
